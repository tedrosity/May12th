                UNT has been a hell of an experience so far.
                Somehow, someway it managed to exceed everything I had planned of.
                From Joe Greene, to Gateway, to the Retreat, I met so many different people
                who impacted my life in so many different ways. I can't think of a better way
                to end the year than this.

                Now I want to give something back to y'all before some of y'all graduate
                or before we go home to run it back for the last time next year.
                It's time to do my big one. Flip the 12 because we celebrating my 21.
